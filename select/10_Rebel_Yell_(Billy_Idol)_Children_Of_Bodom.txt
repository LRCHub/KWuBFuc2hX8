Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
She said, "Hi baby, you've got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above", because...

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, wow!
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when you tired and lonely, she's here to be
What set you free and brought you to me, babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me, because...

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more!
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more

And he lives in his own heaven
There to go from 7-Eleven
Well, he's out all night in American Heaven
Just as long, just as long, it don't mess up her hair

I walked the world for you, babe
Ten thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain
A thousand times for...
I'd sell my soul for you, baby
Oh, for money to burn with you
I'd give you all and have none, babe
Just a, just a, just a, just a, just to have you here by me because...

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more, more, more
