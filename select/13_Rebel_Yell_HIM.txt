Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Last night my little angel came pumpin' on the floor
She said, come on, baby, I got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above

Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, baby, more, more, more
With a rebel yel, she cried more, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me, baby
What set you free, I need you here by me

Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, baby, more, more, more
With a rebel yel, she cried more, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from 7-11
Well, he's out all night to collect a fare
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up his hair
I walked the walls for you babe
A thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain
666 times for you
I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn just for you
I'd give you all and have none, babe
Just-a-just-a-just-a-just-a to have you here by me

Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, baby, more, more, more
With a rebel yel more, more, more
